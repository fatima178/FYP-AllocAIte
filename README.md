# AllocAIte – Staffing Management System

## Overview
AllocAIte is an intelligent staffing management system designed to help managers automatically find the most suitable employee for a task. It uses AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand project descriptions, identify the skills required, and calculate employee availability based on uploaded data. The goal of the system is to make work allocation faster, smarter, and more efficient.

The system allows managers to upload an Excel file containing employee information such as skills, experience, and workload. It then analyses the data to recommend which employees best fit a specific assignment. Results are displayed in an interactive dashboard that shows each employee’s availability timeline. A simple chatbot is also included to answer quick questions.

AllocAIte aims to demonstrate how automation and AI can improve everyday resource planning and decision making in the workplace.
